# Setting Up wandb with Kaggle Notebook

Follow these steps to integrate wandb into your Kaggle notebook for real-time monitoring and management of your machine learning experiments.

## Step 1: Set Up Your wandb Account

- **Create a wandb Account**: Go to [wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai) and sign up for a free account if you haven't already. This will be your portal for viewing experiments and metrics.

## Step 2: Join the deep-learning project

- **Project Invitation**: After creating your account, send your wandb username via messenger. I will add you to the deep-learning project where you can contribute and monitor your experiments.

## Step 3: Configure wandb in Your Kaggle Notebook

- **Secure API Key**: Use the team API key to log into wandb. You can securely store this API key in Kaggle:
  - Navigate to `Add-ons -> Secrets` in your Kaggle notebook.
  - Store your API key with the label `wandb-api-key`.
  
Once these steps are completed, you'll be able to use wandb within your Kaggle notebooks to track experiments, visualize data, and share your results with the team. Enjoy your data-driven adventure!
